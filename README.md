# SHJC Blog Project Year 2016

## Sumamary

This is my blog, just kidding, this is your blog. I created this blog for my adb class.
We were instructed to use some framework called codeigniter but me being me, I decided to take
a different direction. That was to code it from scratch. I think web frameworks are incredibly handy but
I decided to do it from the ground up as I knew it would have a direct impact on my skills, it would teach me stuff I never knew about.

This little blog is using HTML/CSS and some JS for the the front-end/client side. On the server side of things,
it's using PHP and MYSQL. I guess you could say these are the universal standard of creating a dynamic online
application. I really had fun doing this blog. I learnt a ton and even learnt how to do a simple email verification thingy.
Debugging is a realy usefull thing to know and implement because it teaches how to think critically as you try to find
a solution to some problem. And as you could imagine, I had tons of bugs while creating this blog, and some may still even exist.
